/-- Wick rotation data: analytic continuation t → -iτ from Minkowski to Euclidean.
    Only well-defined when the Wightman function satisfies analyticity conditions.

    The Wick rotation relates:
    - Minkowski correlators W_n(x₁,...,xₙ) (oscillatory, distributional)
    - Euclidean correlators S_n(x₁,...,xₙ) (exponentially damped, regular functions)

    via analytic continuation through the forward tube domain. -/

/-- Osterwalder-Schrader reconstruction theorem (corrected version):
    A Euclidean QFT satisfying the OS axioms E1-E5 can be analytically continued
    to a relativistic Wightman QFT.

    CRITICAL: This version includes the growth bound axiom E5 that was missing in
    the original 1973 paper and added in the 1975 follow-up. Without E5, the
    reconstruction fails due to non-convergence of the GNS construction.

    The theorem guarantees existence of analytic Wightman functions that,
    when Wick rotated, reproduce the Schwinger functions. -/
