# BRST Symmetry

BRST (Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin) symmetry is a global fermionic symmetry that
arises in the quantization of gauge theories. It encodes gauge invariance in
a form compatible with path integral quantization.

## Key concepts:

1. **Ghost fields**: Fermionic fields (c, c̄) introduced in gauge fixing.
   Ghosts have the "wrong" spin-statistics but decouple from physical observables.

2. **BRST transformation s**: A nilpotent (s² = 0) fermionic derivation that
   acts on all fields. Physical states are in the BRST cohomology: H(s).

3. **BRST cohomology**: ker(s)/im(s). Physical observables are s-closed but
   not s-exact. Physical states satisfy s|ψ⟩ = 0, |ψ⟩ ≢ s|χ⟩.

4. **Gauge-fixed action**: S_gf = S_inv + s·Ψ where Ψ is the gauge-fixing fermion.
   The partition function is independent of the choice of Ψ.

## Applications:

- Consistent quantization of Yang-Mills theory
- Proof of renormalizability of gauge theories
- Foundation for the BV formalism
- Understanding of anomalies and Wess-Zumino consistency
