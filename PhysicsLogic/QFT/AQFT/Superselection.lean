-- DHR Superselection Theory and Doplicher-Roberts Reconstruction
--
-- This file covers the DHR (Doplicher-Haag-Roberts) analysis of superselection
-- sectors in AQFT. The key insight is that all particle types, their statistics,
-- and the gauge group can be RECONSTRUCTED from the observable algebra alone.
--
-- Key concepts:
-- - Superselection sectors = inequivalent irreducible representations
-- - DHR endomorphisms = localized charges (AQFT substitute for charged fields)
-- - Statistics = phase under particle exchange (bosons, fermions, anyons)
-- - Doplicher-Roberts reconstruction: observables → field algebra + gauge group

/- ============= SUPERSELECTION SECTORS ============= -/

/-- A superselection sector is an equivalence class of irreducible representations.

    Different sectors correspond to different "charge" quantum numbers that
    CANNOT be superposed (hence "superselection rule").

    Examples:
    - Electric charge sectors in QED: ..., -2e, -e, 0, +e, +2e, ...
    - Color confinement in QCD: only color singlets are observable
    - Particle/antiparticle sectors

    The sector type is abstract — it parametrizes the possible charges.
    In specific theories, it would be instantiated to ℤ (for U(1) charge),
    representations of a gauge group, etc. -/

  /-- Trivial (vacuum) sector: the representation of the vacuum state -/

  /-- Charge conjugation: maps a sector to its conjugate (antiparticle) -/

  /-- Fusion with conjugate contains vacuum: ρ ⊗ ρ̄ ∋ vacuum -/

/- ============= DHR ENDOMORPHISMS ============= -/

/-- DHR (Doplicher-Haag-Roberts) endomorphism: a localized charge.

    A DHR endomorphism ρ : A(O) → A(O) represents a charge localized in O.
    It is:
    - A *-endomorphism (algebra homomorphism to itself)
    - Transportable: can be moved to any region by conjugation with unitaries
    - Localized: acts trivially on the spacelike complement A(O')

    This is the AQFT substitute for charged field operators φ(x).
    While φ(x) is not an observable (not gauge-invariant), the endomorphism
    ρ = Ad(φ) captures the same physical content in gauge-invariant form. -/

    endo (net.adjoint A) = net.adjoint (endo A)
  /-- ρ respects the unit -/
  respects_unit : endo net.one = net.one

/- ============= STATISTICS ============= -/

/-- Statistics theory for superselection sectors.

    For localized charges ρ₁, ρ₂ in spacelike separated regions O₁, O₂:
    exchanging them produces a phase ε(ρ₁, ρ₂) = e^{iθ}.

    The statistics parameter depends on spacetime dimension:
    - d ≥ 4: θ ∈ {0, π} only (bosons or fermions)
    - d = 3: θ ∈ [0, 2π) (anyons possible)
    - d = 2: braid statistics (non-abelian statistics possible)

    The proof that only bosons/fermions exist in d ≥ 4 uses topology:
    π₁(Conf_n(ℝ^{d-1})) = S_n (symmetric group) for d ≥ 4,
    which has only 1D reps: trivial (bosons) or sign (fermions).
    For d = 3: π₁(Conf_n(ℝ²)) = B_n (braid group), admitting continuous phases. -/

/-- Bose-Fermi alternative: in d ≥ 4, only bosons (ε = +1) and fermions (ε = -1) exist.

    This is a THEOREM whose proof uses the topology of configuration spaces.
    In d ≥ 4, the fundamental group of the configuration space is the symmetric
    group S_n, whose only 1D representations are trivial and sign. -/

/- ============= DOPLICHER-ROBERTS RECONSTRUCTION ============= -/

/-- Doplicher-Roberts reconstruction data.

    Given:
    - A local net of observables A(O) satisfying Haag-Kastler axioms
    - DHR superselection structure (sectors, statistics, fusion)

    The Doplicher-Roberts theorem reconstructs:
    - A "field algebra" F containing charged (non-gauge-invariant) fields
    - A compact gauge group G
    - Such that A = F^G (observables are gauge invariants of the field algebra)

    This is remarkable: the abstract algebraic structure of observables ALONE
    determines the field content and gauge group! You don't need to start from
    a Lagrangian or specify gauge fields — they emerge from the observable algebra. -/

/- ============= SPIN-STATISTICS THEOREM ============= -/

/-- Spin data for superselection sectors.

    Each sector (particle type) has a spin, which is:
    - Integer for bosons: 0, 1, 2, ...
    - Half-integer for fermions: 1/2, 3/2, 5/2, ...

    In d ≥ 4, spin is determined by the representation of the little group
    (rotation group SO(d-1) for massive particles, or the Euclidean group
    E(d-2) for massless particles). -/
structure SpinData (d : ℕ) (Sector : Type*) where
  /-- Spin of each sector (in units of ℏ) -/
  spin : Sector → ℝ

/-- Spin-statistics theorem: spin determines statistics.

    In d ≥ 4 spacetime dimensions:
    - Integer spin ⟹ Bose statistics (ε = +1, symmetric wave function)
    - Half-integer spin ⟹ Fermi statistics (ε = -1, antisymmetric wave function)

    This follows from:
    - PCT theorem (existence of an antiunitary PCT operator)
    - Cluster decomposition (locality implies factorization at large distances)
    - Positivity of energy (spectrum condition)

    This is a THEOREM derivable from the Haag-Kastler axioms + spin structure. -/
