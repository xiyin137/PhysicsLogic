/- ============= STATES ON LOCAL ALGEBRAS ============= -/

/-- A state ω on a local algebra A(O) is a positive normalized linear functional.

    Properties:
    - ω(1) = 1                           (normalization)
    - ω(A†A) ≥ 0 for all A              (positivity)
    - ω(λA + μB) = λω(A) + μω(B)       (linearity)

    States encode the expectation values of observables and are the
    AQFT analogue of density matrices in ordinary quantum mechanics. -/

/- ============= VACUUM STATE ============= -/

/-- Vacuum state data for a Haag-Kastler QFT.

    The vacuum state is characterized by:
    - Poincaré invariance: ω₀(α_g(A)) = ω₀(A) for all g in the Poincaré group
    - It is the ground state (minimizes energy)
    - It is unique up to phase

    Physical meaning: this is the state of "empty space" — no particles,
    no excitations, the same for all inertial observers. -/

    (A : qft.net.Algebra O),
    (vacuumState O).omega A =
    (vacuumState (poincareImageGen g O)).omega ((qft.covariance O g).alpha A)

/- ============= GNS CONSTRUCTION ============= -/

/-- GNS representation: a state produces a Hilbert space representation.

    Given a state ω on A(O), the GNS construction produces:
    - A Hilbert space H_ω
    - A *-representation π_ω : A(O) → B(H_ω)
    - A cyclic vector Ω_ω ∈ H_ω such that ω(A) = ⟨Ω_ω|π_ω(A)|Ω_ω⟩

    This is the rigorous bridge between algebraic AQFT (operator algebras)
    and the Hilbert space formulation (Wightman axioms).
    The GNS theorem guarantees existence for every state on a C*-algebra. -/

/- ============= CAUSAL STRUCTURE ============= -/

/-- Causal complement O' of a region O:
    the set of all points spacelike separated from every point in O.

    The causal complement plays a central role in AQFT:
    - A(O') contains all observables that commute with A(O) (by locality)
    - Haag duality says: A(O)' = A(O') for causally complete regions -/
def causalComplement {d : ℕ} [NeZero d]
    (O : Set (SpaceTimePointD d)) : Set (SpaceTimePointD d) :=
  {y | ∀ x ∈ O,
    (x 0 - y 0) ^ 2 < ∑ i : Fin d, if i.val = 0 then 0 else (x i - y i) ^ 2}

/-- A region is causally complete if O'' = O
    (taking the causal complement twice gives back the original region).

    Causally complete regions are the "natural" domains for AQFT:
    - Double cones are causally complete
    - Wedge regions are causally complete
    - Half-spaces are NOT causally complete -/
def CausallyComplete {d : ℕ} [NeZero d]
    (O : Set (SpaceTimePointD d)) : Prop :=
  causalComplement (causalComplement O) = O

/- ============= HAAG DUALITY ============= -/

/-- Haag duality: for causally complete regions, the commutant of A(O)
    equals A(O'). Equivalently: A(O)'' = A(O) (double commutant theorem).

    This is NOT a consequence of the Haag-Kastler axioms — it is an
    ADDITIONAL property that well-behaved QFTs satisfy.

    Physical meaning: everything that commutes with all O-observables
    must be localized in the causal complement O'.
    Nothing "hides" between O and O'. -/
structure HasHaagDuality {d : ℕ} [NeZero d] (qft : HaagKastlerQFT d) where
  /-- Observables in O and O' commute when embedded in a common region -/
  haag_duality : ∀ (O : Set (SpaceTimePointD d))
    (_h_complete : CausallyComplete O)
    (A : qft.net.Algebra O)

    (O_full : Set (SpaceTimePointD d))
    (h1 : O ⊆ O_full)
    (h2 : causalComplement O ⊆ O_full),
    qft.net.mul (qft.net.inclusion h1 A) (qft.net.inclusion h2 B) =
    qft.net.mul (qft.net.inclusion h2 B) (qft.net.inclusion h1 A)

/- ============= REEH-SCHLIEDER THEOREM ============= -/

/-- Reeh-Schlieder theorem: for ANY nonempty open region O, no matter how small,
    acting with local operators A ∈ A(O) on the vacuum |Ω⟩ produces a dense
    set in the full Hilbert space.

    Physical implications:
    - The vacuum is entangled across all of space (vacuum entanglement)
    - No perfect localization of states is possible
    - Even a tiny region "contains" information about the whole universe

    NOTE: This does NOT mean you can create arbitrary states with bounded energy
    from a small region. The operators needed may have arbitrarily large norm.

    This is a THEOREM derivable from Haag-Kastler axioms (A1-A5). -/

/- ============= SPLIT PROPERTY ============= -/

/-- Split property: for nested regions O₁ ⊂⊂ O₂ (O₁ relatively compact in O₂,
    with a "gap" between them), the inclusion A(O₁) ⊆ A(O₂) factors through
    a type I factor N: A(O₁) ⊆ N ⊆ A(O₂).

    This is an ADDITIONAL property (nuclearity condition) that implies:
    - Statistical independence of spacelike separated regions
    - Good thermodynamic behavior (finite entropy density)
    - Existence of product states across spacelike separated regions

    Not all QFTs satisfy this — it requires a sufficiently "thin" spectrum
    at high energies (nuclearity of the energy-level density). -/
structure HasSplitProperty {d : ℕ} [NeZero d] (qft : HaagKastlerQFT d) where
  /-- For nested regions with a gap, independent states can be prepared.
      Given states on A(O₁) and on A(causalComplement O₂), there exists
      a joint state on a larger region that restricts correctly to both. -/
  split : ∀ (O₁ O₂ : Set (SpaceTimePointD d))
    (h : O₁ ⊆ O₂)

    ∃ (ω : StateOnAlgebra qft.net O_full),
      ∀ A : qft.net.Algebra O₁,
        ω.omega (qft.net.inclusion (h.trans h1) A) = ω₁.omega A

/- ============= HAAG'S THEOREM ============= -/

/-- Haag's theorem: in relativistic QFT, if two theories share the same vacuum
    state and Poincaré transformation properties, they are unitarily equivalent.

    CONSEQUENCE: The naive interaction picture (where the interaction is
    "turned on adiabatically") CANNOT work in relativistic QFT, because
    the interacting and free theories have different vacua, and hence
    live in unitarily inequivalent representations.

    This is why rigorous QFT requires:
    - Renormalization (to absorb vacuum energy differences)
    - Non-perturbative constructions (AQFT, constructive QFT, lattice)
    - Careful treatment of the adiabatic limit

    This is a THEOREM derivable from the Haag-Kastler axioms. -/

/- ============= MODULAR THEORY (TOMITA-TAKESAKI) ============= -/

/-- Modular data for a local algebra with respect to the vacuum.

    The Tomita-Takesaki theorem provides, for any von Neumann algebra M
    with a cyclic and separating vector Ω:
    - Modular operator Δ (positive self-adjoint, unbounded)
    - Modular conjugation J (antiunitary involution)

    Fundamental properties:
    - JMJ = M' (commutant)
    - Δ^{it} M Δ^{-it} = M for all t ∈ ℝ (modular automorphism group)
    - The vacuum satisfies the KMS condition at β = 1 w.r.t. modular flow

    Connection to physics:
    - For wedge regions, the modular flow IS the Lorentz boost (Bisognano-Wichmann)
    - For Rindler wedge, KMS at β = 2π gives the Unruh temperature T = 1/(2π)
    - Modular theory unifies thermodynamics and spacetime geometry -/

/-- Standard right wedge region W_R = {x | x¹ > |x⁰|} in d ≥ 2 dimensions.

    Wedges are important because:
    - They are invariant under boosts in the x¹ direction
    - The vacuum is cyclic AND separating for A(W) (Reeh-Schlieder + wedge duality)
    - The modular flow for A(W) has a geometric interpretation (Bisognano-Wichmann)

/- ============= BISOGNANO-WICHMANN THEOREM ============= -/

/-- Bisognano-Wichmann theorem: for wedge regions, the modular automorphism
    group σ_t = Δ^{it}(·)Δ^{-it} acts as Lorentz boosts with rapidity 2πt,
    and the modular conjugation J acts as PCT transformation.

    σ_t(A) = α_{Λ(2πt)}(A)  for A ∈ A(W)
    where Λ(η) is the boost with rapidity η in the x¹ direction.

    This remarkable connection links:
    - Abstract algebraic structure (modular theory)
    - Geometric symmetry (Lorentz boosts)
    - Thermodynamics (KMS condition at inverse temperature β = 2π)
