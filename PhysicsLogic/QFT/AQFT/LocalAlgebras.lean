open SpaceTime

/-- A point in d-dimensional spacetime -/
abbrev SpaceTimePointD (d : ℕ) := Fin d → ℝ

/-- A net of local C*-algebras indexed by spacetime regions.

    In AQFT, each bounded open region O of spacetime is assigned a
    C*-algebra A(O) of observables localized in that region.

    Key assumptions bundled here:
    - Each A(O) is a unital C*-algebra (mul, add, smul, adjoint, one, norm)
    - There are inclusion maps A(O₁) → A(O₂) when O₁ ⊆ O₂
    - The C*-identity ‖A†A‖ = ‖A‖² holds

    This structure encodes the *algebraic* data. The physical axioms
    (locality, covariance, spectrum condition) are in HaagKastlerQFT. -/

  /-- Algebra addition: A + B -/

  /-- Scalar multiplication: λ · A for λ ∈ ℂ -/
  smul : ∀ {O}, ℂ → Algebra O → Algebra O
  /-- Adjoint (Hermitian conjugate): A† -/
  adjoint : ∀ {O}, Algebra O → Algebra O
  /-- Unit element: 1 ∈ A(O) -/
  one : ∀ {O}, Algebra O
  /-- C*-norm: ‖A‖ -/
  norm : ∀ {O}, Algebra O → ℝ
  /-- Inclusion for nested regions: O₁ ⊆ O₂ → A(O₁) → A(O₂)

      This is the isotony data: observables in a smaller region
      are also observables in any larger region containing it.
      Together with the isotony axiom (in Axioms.lean), this makes
      the assignment O ↦ A(O) into a functor. -/
